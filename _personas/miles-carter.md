A graphic designer with an award-winning background in print design, Miles du Plessis has reluctantly migrated to the web and is currently employed as a graphic design for a boutique web design company in Johannesburg, South Africa.  His company advertises that they will “build a beautiful brand” for their clients and Miles does most of the early conceptual and problem solving work by providing a range of visual presentation styles that reflect the correct use of typography, space, image and color for the specific project. Miles never thought about accessibility when designing for print and now struggles with web accessibility requirements and is often confused by them.

He is motivated by his belief that design is a structure that anticipates written and visual content that has not yet been created.  His early work included creating signage and iconography for physical spaces and he understands design as the way to clarify relationships between parts. He sees this to be an important place where the designer brings value.  He is sometimes intimidated by his lack of mastery of new technologies and is not actually very interested in the overall subject of accessibility, despite the fact that he has a hearing impairment himself. When there are client inquiries or requirements for accessibility or responsive design, he just asks that he be given “…the rules and I will follow them.”    He is a vegetarian, a runner, and a dog lover, with an Australian shepherd named Ollie who Miles believes is smarter than most of his colleagues.
