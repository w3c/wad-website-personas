Andy O'Sullivan is "elite", a hardcore code monkey. He is 39 years old, single and works for a software development company in Spain that employs about 200 people.  Andy runs the Web servers, and leads the coding team for the company Web site. The most experienced guy in the company he takes the lead with technical decisions. He thinks all this accessibility stuff is just PC [politically correct] junk and that few people with disabilities ever use his site.

“I have a deadline, and it's not like we have any disabled users anyway,” he says “I looked at the server logs, I should know.”  Andy doesn't see the need for accessibility. His boss heard about it and told him to check it out and report back to the team. Andy's goal is to gather some quick, concise information about accessibility, and see what's involved to implement it on the company site. His main interest is in placating his boss so he can work on other things.  Since Andy is the leader of the Web team and his boss is relying on his judgement, the company direction on accessibility will ultimately be his decision. Unless he sees the need for accessibility he isn't going to waste his time.  Andy is an amateur musician who plays fiddle on Wednesday evenings in a local pub with a group of other Celtic music lovers and players who gather for pleasure and learning.
