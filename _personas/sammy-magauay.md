A full stack web programmer who lives in Manila, the Philippines, Sammy Santos works freelance contracts for web development projects of all sizes using various technologies. He is married with four small children and is a time management wizard.  His backend skills include PHP, Codeigniter, Sql/NoSql, and more. Front end skills include HTML5, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Webcomponents, etc. Sammy manages small teams as needed and provides some system administration as well. Because of his broad skill set and freelance status, Sammy has clients from all over the world with various accessibility requests and requirements.

He subscribes to the WAI-IG and tries to stay current with emerging accessibility challenges and solutions.  He is not especially active in the WAI community, but is a consistent lurker to the list and to the #a11y hashtag on Twitter.  He is confident in his understanding of accessibility goals and the general application of ARIA and WCAG rules.  He gets impatient however, when sorting through various interpretations and lack of consistent browser and AT support for what he feels are properly coded web applications.
