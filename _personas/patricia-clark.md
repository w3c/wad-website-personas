Patricia Clark is a senior executive for a California Metro Transit company recently sued for a range of accessibility violations. In addition to improving the accessibility of their transportation services, the company must deliver to the courts a comprehensive web accessibility improvement plan to be implemented over the next five years. Patricia is guiding the effort, including developing accessibility policy, procedures, hiring practices, web and mobile app redesign and more that she “has probably not even thought of yet.”

Patricia has an MBA from the University of San Francisco and is a seasoned professional and problem solver who knows how to support a team when faced with difficult challenges.  She understands the issues since she has acquired age related disabilities over the last several years. She has serious arthritis and uses voice input software that maps to the keyboard. Patricia is particularly interested in providing her staff with the tools they need for success and is seeking long term solutions that will be integrated into their systems going forward.   She has three grown children and a new baby granddaughter with whom she enjoys family gatherings, cooking for her extended family, and shopping trips to Mexico.
